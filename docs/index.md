!!! note "Contribute?"
    If you would like to contribute to the documentation of CiviBanking you can certainly do so! Every  now and then sprints to update the documentation are organised. In most cases this will be announced on the CiviCRM channels. If you want to make sure you are invited for the next one please drop [betty.dolfing@civicoop.org](mailto:betty.dolfing@civicoop.org) or [erik.hommel@civicoop.org](mailto:erik.hommel@civicoop.org) a mail.

CiviBanking is a great extension that can read and interpret files with payments you can get from your bank or payment provider. So this could be a file from your bank, but also a downloaded file from Mollie, PayPal or Visa.
 
The extension will import the data, transform it to generic transactions that it can process and then match those with the related contributions in CiviCRM and mark them as completed (or suggest you create new contributions or even contacts). And for quite a few scenario's it can do this automatically too!
