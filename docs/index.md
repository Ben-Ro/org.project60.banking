CiviBanking is a CiviCRM extension for analysing and processing bank statements
or transaction reports exported from payment providers, such as PayPal, Mollie,
or Visa.

The extension can import transaction from these statements into a
CiviBanking-internal data structure which, in turn, can then be entered as
CiviCRM Contribution entities. Also, connecting those to e.g. memberships or
campaigns is possible.

Since a bank account is crucial information for reconciling bank statement
transactions, CiviBanking provides a new entity for storing bank account
information on contact records in multiple formats, e.g. IBAN, national account
and bank numbers, or payment provider identifiers.

Since the configuration is highly individual, quite a lot of scenarios can be
modeled with CiviBanking, and also be set up to process automatically.
