### Regex Analyser Plugin

A _Regex Analyser_ plugin can check in the imported data if a field contains
specific text, like _PAYPAL_ or _paypal_ in the _purpose_ field, and set
attributes in transaction data based on its findings, e.g. the financial type
could be set to a certain value.

The _analyser plugin_ will have configuration details to specify the regular
expression to evaluate (more information on Regular Expressions
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)), what fields to check,
and how to enrich transaction data with the correct values.
