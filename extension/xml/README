To generate the DAO, you have to symlink to xml/schema/banking from your civicrm and symlink xml/BankingSchema.xml

add into xml/Schema.xml
<xi:include href="Banking/files.xml" parse="xml" />

to generate the DAO+xml, you need to 
$cd civicrm_root/xml
$php Gencode.php


Alternatively, you can just run my shell script in the civicrm folder:
```
> sh ~/Documents/workspace/CiviBanking/tools/generate_banking_daos.sh
```

It will do all the steps above, and (hopefully) remove all traces in your civicrm installation. Except for the DAOs being regenerated.
